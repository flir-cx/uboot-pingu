LEDs connected to TI LP5562 controller

This driver works with a TI LP5562 4-channel LED controller.
CONFIG_LED_BLINK is supported using the controller engines.  However
there are only 3 engines available for the 4 channels.  This means
that the blue and white channels share the same engine.  When both
blue and white LEDs are set to blink, they will share the same blink
rate.  Changing the blink rate of the blue LED will affect the white
LED and vice-versa.  Manual on/off is handled independtly for all
4 channels.

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "ti,lp5562-leds".
  - #address-cells : must be 1.
  - #size-cells : must be 0.
  - reg : LP5562 LED controller I2C address.

Optional properties:
  - gpios : Enable GPIO
  - ti,external_clock : Boolean, configures controller for external
    32 kHZ clock input.  Default : false (use internal clock)

Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the ti,lp5562-leds device.

LED sub-node required properties:
  - reg : PWM register number for channel

LED sub-node optional properties:
  - label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - ti,led_current : LED current at max brightness in 100uA steps (0x00 - 0xFF)
    Default : 0x64 (10 ma)

Example:
        leds0: lp5562@30 {
                compatible = "ti,lp5562-leds";
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;
                gpios = <&gpio3 9 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
                reg = <0x30>;

                blue@0 {
                        reg = <0x2>;
                        label = "blue";
                        ti,led_current = <0xC8>; /* 20ma */
                };
                green@1 {
                        reg = <0x3>;
                        label = "green";
                        ti,led_current = <0xC8>; /* 20ma */
                };
                red@2 {
                        reg = <0x4>;
                        label = "red";
                        ti,led_current = <0xC8>; /* 20ma */
                };
                white@3 {
                        reg = <0xE>;
                        label = "white";
                        ti,led_current = <0xC8>; /* 20ma */
                };
        };
